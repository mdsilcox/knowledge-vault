name: vault
description: The owner's knowledge vault across all projects (basic-memory MCP server, plain Markdown notes). Use when starting research or a stack choice, when hitting a problem that may have been solved before in another project, when the owner says "check the vault", "have we seen this before?", "save this to the vault" or "remember this", and at the writing moments: after a research report, when a decision is logged, at a phase retro, and when a problem is solved in a reusable way.

# The knowledge vault

One vault of Markdown notes holds the distilled findings of every project: reusable fixes, facts learned, decisions and research. It is searched only when needed. Each project's own memory and docs stay where they are; the vault holds what another project could reuse.

Tools (MCP server `basic-memory`): use only `search_notes`, `read_note`, `write_note` and `edit_note`. Ignore the project, workspace, schema, cloud and diagnostics tools.

## When to search
- Starting research, a survey or a stack choice.
- Hitting an error or problem that might have been seen before.
- The owner asks.

Search once with a plain-language description of the problem (meaning matters more than exact words), read the top one or two notes that fit, and use them. Don't browse the vault or search for every small step. Say in a short line when a note helped ("The vault has a note on this from knowledge-vault: ...").

## When to write
- After a research report: one `research` note for the survey, plus one `finding` per key fact.
- When a decision is logged that another project could reuse: a `decision` note.
- At a phase retro: a `pattern` or `finding` for each lesson worth keeping.
- When a problem is solved in a way worth reusing: a `pattern` note.
- Whenever the owner says so.

Don't write one-project trivia (that belongs in the project's memory), whole transcripts, or copies of project docs (link to them with `source`).

## How to write
1. **Search first.** If a note already covers it, `edit_note` it (add the new case, evidence or project; set `updated`) instead of writing a near-duplicate.
2. **Pick the type and folder:**
   | Type | Folder | For | Sections |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | `pattern` | `patterns` | a problem that may recur and the fix that worked | Problem, Cause, Solution, When it applies |
   | `finding` | `findings` | a fact learned: tool behavior, a limit, a measurement | Finding, Evidence, Implications |
   | `decision` | `decisions` | a choice another project could reuse | Context, Chosen, Rejected, Why |
   | `research` | `research` | a survey or comparison | Question, Options compared, Verdict, Sources |
   | `note` | `notes` | anything else the owner asks to keep | free |
3. **Title** = the filename: a short claim in sentence case that states the point ("Obsidian Git is unstable on iOS"). No dates or project names in titles.
4. **Call `write_note`** with `title`, `directory` (the folder), `note_type` (the type), `tags` (lowercase topics, no project names), and `metadata`: `{"project": "<project slug>", "created": "YYYY-MM-DD", "status": "active", "source": "<path in the project repo, URL, or chat>"}`. The project slug is the project's folder or repo name in kebab case; use `general` when it isn't tied to a project.
5. **Body:** the type's sections, briefly. Plain sentences, American spelling, no em dashes. Link related notes with `[[Title]]` when a search while writing turned up a close match.
6. **Don't** add the project link, update the project hub, commit or push: the vault's hook does that after every write. If the hook reports a problem (a secret, a broken link, a push that failed), fix it or tell the owner.

## Ask the owner first
- Before deleting, moving or superseding a note. To supersede, set `status: superseded` and `superseded_by: "[[Newer note]]"`; never delete.
- Before writing anything that might be sensitive or personal.
- Before rewriting most of an existing note.

## Never
Secrets of any kind (tokens, keys, passwords). The hook blocks them, but don't rely on it.
